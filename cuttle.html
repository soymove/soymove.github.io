            <span id = summarytext>Before the cuttlefish project, when I was doing the banner research, there was time that I looked into the CTR(Click Through Rate) data of the ads. Unfortunately, the average CTR is too low in general, the data is usually messy due to lots of bots, and there are various confounding variables that it was hard to find a variable that has as significant influence over the CTR. Except for one; the more sizes the ads support, the more impression could be generated in the agreeable price. The problem was with the existing design system, supporting more ads sizes takes considerable amount of design resource. 
 </span>

            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle1">
            </div>
            <p>
            Yet, there was an existing project that explored algorithms that dynamically resize ads and their elements. So the Cuttlefish was born, a tool that designs the retargeting ads that can incorporate dynamic product feed and that can fit into any inventory.
</p>
           
            <p>
            Since the UX team's desk was full with other projects at that moment, it was decided that the designers in the banner team would design the tool by themselves. The main challenge of creating the cuttlefish was to abstract the most used cases and controls needed to design the retargeting ads and the banner team could do the job best by using their accumulated knowledge. It was planned that UX team would review the design of the banner team, share feedback and then developers take over.

            </p>
            <p>
            However, by the time the banner team finished the mock-ups(image above), the project faced a new business direction. The business wanted to open up the internal tool to the external users. The cuttlefish is not just for the banner designers anymore. I joined the Cuttlefish project to make sure that the tool can be beneficial to both the designers and the first-time users.
</p>
            
            <p>
            While reviewing the initial mock-ups designed by banner team with my laptop, I first noticed that the mock-up fits only into the big iMac screen. From then on, I started to write down a list of things that should be touched. While creating the list, I shared the mock-up with other non-designer colleagues to get mimic the user experience of the first-time user. From these, I identified key differences to keep in mind and started iterations. Then, I returned back to the banner team to share my design and get feedback. Then I talked to the developers to get the confirmation and align ideas. By repeating those processes, I ended up creating participatory design loop.
</p>
            
           
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle3">
            </div>
             <p>
           The loop has three parts; one is listening to the non-designer's feedback. Based on the feedback, I iterated the new cuttlefish and then reviewed the changes with the designers. After the iteration, the banner team and I invited developers to confirm the specifics and expand the functionality of the new cuttlefish.
</p>
            
            <p>
           I was particularly cautious to make sure that the banner team has full access to all the conversations. Since the initial project owner was the banner team, I didn't want them to feel like the other team is taking over and ignoring the existing work. Instead of setting up regular meetings, I opened a channel for ad-hoc meetings with the banner team so that whenever there is an agenda to discuss, we could talk openly. The ad-hoc meeting usually lasted less than an hour and happened 3 or 4 times a week. 

            </p>
            <p>At the same time, I made sure to be the new product owner; to be fully responsible of the design decisions, represent various users and deliver the take-aways after the meeting along with the goal for the next one. One take-away from the previous collaboration project across various teams was that the great discussion leads to nothing without the clear ownership. Someone has to reflect the discussion into the actual product and make sure that everyone is heading towards the same direction. 

            </p>
            <p>
            Thanks to users, designers, and developers, discussion was almost all the time productive. Instead of defending different perspectives, we all contributed and appreciated the input from the others. The other team members told me that it is nice that their voices were being heard and the product was constantly improving. To summarize the key updates of the new cuttlefish:

            </p>
            <p><span id = "impcontents">1. Overall layout </span>
                <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle2">
            </div>  
                 <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle4">
            </div> 
                
            <p>
To adjust to the smaller screen size, the new cuttlefish used narrower control panels that grow vertically. The new cuttlefish used the wide preview window in the center.
            </p>
                <br><span id = "impcontents">2. Preview window</span>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle5">
            </div> 
            <p>
            The preview window by default shows ads in common sizes. Yet, user can choose a certain size or select the custom size to test the edge cases. The preview window includes short cuts such as turning the hover preview on and off.
</p>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle6">
            </div> 
            <p>
           The preview window also functions as the selector so that users can navigate to various control panels by clicking the preview image instead of the text-based left sidebar. When the user hovers certain element in the preview window, the element is highlighted. When the user clicks, the corresponding panel for the element appears. This helps users who are not familiar with the names of each element to quickly access the control panel.

            </p>
            <br><span id = "impcontents">3. Priority and layout</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle7">
            </div><br>
             <div class = inimage id = "cuttle8">
            </div>
            
            <p> Setting a priority of the elements is important in Cuttlefish since the priority determines what elements gets displayed when the inventory size is small. The priority is also tied to the layout so the initial mock-up. The initial mock-up solved the two problems in one interface, yet, it was not easily understood by the non-design users. In the new Cuttlefish, the priority and the layout is handled separately by drag-and-drop interfaces.

            </p>
            <br>
            <span id = "impcontents">4. User Flow</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle9">
            </div>
            <p> The non-designer users found it very hard to approach the tool and start designing banners without any guidelines. Therefore, the left-side bar is designed with a flow. User can start from the first menu and then move down to the menu below. When all the menu is covered, the banner design is over.
</p>
            <br>
            
            <span id = "impcontents">5. Visual illustration</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle10">
            </div>
            <p> Instead of using the text-based menu, all options are illustrated by the graphics so that the user who is not familiar with design terms can understand ideas intuitively.
 </p>
            <br>
            
            <span id = "impcontents">6. Tutorial</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle11">
            </div>
            <p> There is some inherent knowledge gap between the non-designer and the banner design team which includes terminology (ex. USP) and understanding of the concept of standard retargeting ads. To fill in the first-time user with those quick but useful information, a short tutorial is created.</p>
