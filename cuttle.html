            <span id = summarytext>Before the cuttlefish project when I was doing the banner research, there was a time that I looked into the CTR(Click Through Rate) data of the ads. Unfortuantely, the average CTR is too low in general, the data is usually messy due to lots of bots, and there are various confounding variables that it was hard to find a variable that has as significant influence over the CTR. Yet, there was one finding; the more sizes the ads support, the more impression could be generated in the agreeable price. The problem was with the existing design system, supporting more ads sizes meant taking more design resources. </span>

<br><br>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle1">
            </div>
            <p>
            Yet, there was an existing project that explored algorithms that can dynamically resize ads and their elements. There also was a business need to provide a tool that can quickly generate standard retargeting ads so that the design resrouce coule be used for creating more tailored ads. So the Cuttlefish was born. The tool that designs the retargeting ads that can incorporate dynamic product feed and that can fit into any inventory.</p>
           
            <p>
            Since the UX team's desk was full with other projects at that moment, it was decided that the banner team would design the tool by themselves. Since the main challenge of creating the cuttlefish tool is to abstract the most used controls in designing banners, we thought the banner team could do the job best. It was planned that UX team would review the design of the banner team, share some feedback and then developers take the design over. 
            </p>
            <p>
            However, by the time the banner team finished the mock-ups(image above), the project faced a new business direction which is opening up the internal tools to the external users. I joined the Cuttlefish project to make sure that the tool can be beneficial to both the designers and the first-time users. </p>
            
            <p>
            While reviewing the initial mock-up image designed by banner team with my laptop, I first noticed that the mock-up is designed to fit into the big iMac screen. From this, I started to take notes of the first-time users that should now be considered. While creating the list, I shared the mock-up with other colleagues to mimic the experience of the first-time user and identified the key differences to keep in mind. Then, I started iterations. And then I returned back to the banner team to share my design and get feedback. Then I turned back to the developers to get the confirmation and align ideas. After repeating those processes, I ended up creating participatory design loop. </p>
            
           
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle3">
            </div>
             <p>
            The loop was made of three parts; one is listening to the non-designer's feedback. Based on the feedback, I iterated the new cuttlefish and then reviewed the changes with the designers. After the iteration, the banner team and I invited developers to confirm the specifics and expand the functionality of the new cuttlefish. </p>
            
            <p>
            I was particularly cautious to make sure that the banner team has full access to all the conversations. Since the initial project owner was the banner team, I didn't want them to feel like the other team is taking over their work. Instead of sticking to the regular meetings, I opened a channel for ad-hoc meetings with the banner team so that whenever there is a agenda to discuss, we could talk openly. The ad-hoc meeting usually lasted less than a year and happened about 3 times a week. After every ad-hoc meeting, we added a block on the Cuttlefish design.
            </p>
            <p>At the same time, I made sure to be fully responsible of the design decisions, represent various users and deliver the take-aways after the meeing along with the goal for the next one. One take-away from the previous collaboration project across various teams was that the great discussion leads to nothing without a clear owner who will reflect the discussion into the actual product and I didn't want to repeat the similar hazy teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
            And it did not happen! Thanks to all users, designers, and developers, discussion was productive and we all shared the feeling that voices are being heard and the product is being improved. Instead of defending each perspective, we all contributed and appreciated the participation of each others. The descritipn of the key focus follows. 
            </p>
            <p><span id = "impcontents">1. Overall layout </span>
                <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle2">
            </div>  
                 <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle4">
            </div> 
                
            <p>
            To adjust to the smaller screen size, the new cuttlefish used narrower controls that can grow vertically. The new cuttlefish still kept the wide preview window in the center. 
            </p>
                <br><span id = "impcontents">2. Preview window</span>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle5">
            </div> 
            <p>
            The preview window by default shows ads in common sizes. Yet, user can only choose a certain size or select the see how the ad will look like in the custom size. It also includes some short cuts such as turning the hover mode preview on and off.</p>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle6">
            </div> 
            <p>
            The preview window also functions as the selector so that users can navigate to various panels by clicking the image instead of using the text-based left sidebar. When the user hovers certain element in the preview window, the element will be highlighted. When the user clicks, the corresponding panel for the element will appear. This GUI UI helps users who are not familiar with the names of each element.
            </p>
            <br><span id = "impcontents">3. Priority and layout</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle7">
            </div><br>
             <div class = inimage id = "cuttle8">
            </div>
            
            <p> Setting the priority is important in the Cuttlefish tool since priroity determines what elements should be displayed when the inventory size is small. The priroity is also tied to the layout so the initial mock-up intended to solve the two problems together. Yet, in the new Cuttlefish, the priroity is set in the beginning by drag-and-drop list interface. Then in the deal layout user can focus on the visual arrangment again by drag-and-drop.
            </p>
            <br>
            <span id = "impcontents">4. User Flow</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle9">
            </div>
            <p> The non-designer users found it very hard to approach the tool when no guide is given. Therefore, the left-side bar is designed with a flow so that the user can start from the first menu and then move down to the menu below. </p>
            <br>
            
            <span id = "impcontents">5. Visual illustration</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle10">
            </div>
            <p> Instead of using the text-based menu, all the choices are illustrated by the graphics so that the user who is not familiar with design terms can understand inutuivitely. </p>
            <br>
            
            <span id = "impcontents">6. Tutorial</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle11">
            </div>
            <p> There is some inherent knowledge gap between the non-designer and the banner design team which includes terminology (such as USP) and the understanding of the concept of standard retargeting ads. To fill in the first-time user with those quick but useful information, a short tutorial is created.</p>
