</span>

            
            <p>
            When I was doing the banner research looking into the CTR(Click Through Rate) data of the ads, there was one factor that seemed to have a significant influence. While the average CTR is too low in general and the data is very messy due to bots, the more inventory sizes the ads support, the more impression was generated. The problem was with the existing retargeting ads design process, supporting more ads sizes takes the considerable amount of time.<br></p>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle1">
            </div>
            <div class = "footnotes">The 18 common inventory sizes. Just <b>18</b> sizes! </div>
            
            <p>
            There was an existing related project though; it explored algorithms that dynamically resize ads and adopt elements to fit the various sizes. The idea of the Cuttlefish was there, a tool that designs size-agnostic retargeting ads <b>easy</b> and <b>fast</b>. </p>
           
            <p>
            Since UX team's desk was full, it was initially decided that the banner team would design the tool by themselves and I would review the final design. However, by the time banner team finished the mock-ups, the company was pushing an "open and transparent" business. The business wanted to open up the internal tool to the external users so they could configure and design banners as well. The cuttlefish was not just for the banner designers anymore. Since I have been keen on Creatives, I took a lead role in transforming the Cuttlefish into the retargeting ads design tool for everyone. 
</p><a name="c_1"></a>
            <p>
             While reviewing the initial mock-ups, I identified three major points to be reconsidered: first, the screen size; second, userflow; third, terms and general knowledge. </p>
            <p><br><br><br><br>
                
            <span id = "impcontents">1. Screen size & Focus on preview window</span>
                
                    <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle2"> </div>
            <div class = "footnotes">Initial mock-ups from the banner design team: fonts and preview window are small</div>
                
            <p>
The first thing I noticed was that the mock-ups from the banner design team were based on the huge iMac screen. The fonts and the preview windows were small that when I opened the mock-ups in the laptop screen, I couldn't read the labels properly. Since Cuttlefish is no longer for internal designers who use iMac screens, I adjusted the design. Fixing this was straightforward. I minimized the empty space in the sidebars and slimmed down the control panels. I increased the fonts in general and kept the smallest label size to 10pt.</p>
            
            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle4"></div> 
            <div class = "footnotes">New mock-ups : fonts and preview window are bigger and the preview window contains various inventory sizes </div>
            
            <p>
            Another point that caught my eyes was a relatively weak preview window. In Cuttlefish, ads are <b>automatically</b> resized for various inventory sizes. Therefore, while it is impossible to preview all the ads, it is critical to be able to see how one's configuration is reflected in various sizes. The new preview window by default shows ads in common sizes and user can select the custom size and play around. 
            </p>

            <div class = "inimage" id = "cuttle12"></div> 
            <div class = "footnotes">Preview window supports the custom-size preview and can function as a selector </div>
              <a name="c_2"></a>
            <p>
            The preview window also functions as the selector so that users can navigate to various control panels by clicking the preview image instead of using the text-based sidebars. When the user hovers on a certain element in the preview window, the element is highlighted. When the user clicks, the corresponding panel for the element appears. While the banner team didn't find this feature it particularly useful, non-expert user really liked this. They were not familiar with the names of each element so being able to quickly and visually access control panels was crucial.
            </p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                
            
            
            <span id = "impcontents">2. Explaining priority & layout in a clear manner</span>
            
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle7"></div>
            <div class = "footnotes">The layout & priority control in the initial mock-ups : information is cluttered and hard to tell what controls what</div>

            
            <p> Setting a priority of the elements is important in Cuttlefish since the priority determines which element gets displayed when the inventory size is small. The priority is tied to the layout in that sense, so the initial mock-up connected the two controls in a single interface. The problem is including various controls at one interface made the interface hard to be understood. In the new Cuttlefish, the priority and the layout are handled separately by drag-and-drop interaction. The banner design team as well as non-designers found this separation more intuitive and less confusing.            </p>

                
                 <div class = inimage id = "cuttle13"></div><a name="c_3"></a>
                <div class = "footnotes">New Cuttlefish separates the two concepts and describes the ideas visually</div>

            <br>
            
            
             <br><br><br><br>
            
            <span id = "impcontents">3. Navigation & layout can guide how user should think</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle14"></div>
            <div class = "footnotes">Left : mock-ups from the designers, Right : the new Cuttlefish that has smaller sequential steps</div>

            <p> It was during this Cuttlefish project that I realized how the navigation can <b>Guide</b> how user should approach the problem. When testing with the non-designer users, I often found people not being able to <b>start</b>. They had difficulties approaching the tool not because they didn't know how to change the text color, for example, but because they didn't know how to design banners without any guidelines. Therefore, I designed the left-side bar that has small steps with an innate flow. User can start from the first menu and then move down to the menu below. When finished all the steps, the banner design is complete.
</p> 
            <p> The sequential navigation that guides user step-by-step was effective; however, one user pointed out an important downside. The user said <b>"If I don't have a clear idea of what banners you want to create, I think I will go back and force to try different stuff."</b> As the user said, the problem with the sequential navigation was  that it is hard to iterate or play with two factors at the same time. User had to change the color of the box in one menu and the layout of the box in the other menu. Going back and force was unnecessary and bothersome. </p>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle15"></div>
            <div class = "footnotes">When the 'Deal' is clicked from the left side bar, the right side bar with components of deals shows up</div><a name="c_4"></a>
           <p>So I added one more navigation bars on the right side and created a parallel flow. Left side navigation keeps the big picture and guides the main flow. The right side menu provides the subflow and focuses on styling. This way, user could handle the layout and contextual configuration while playing around with the styling of the specific elements at the same time. </p>
            
            <br><br><br><br>
            <span id = "impcontents">4. Tutorial, yes</span>
            <div class = inimage id = "cuttle10">
            </div>
            <p> No matter how Cuttlefish design progresses, there was one thing that I had to repeat all the time before the user testing with non-experts. It was about the basic concept and terms of retargeting ads -- where the dynamic information kicks in, what USP or CTA means and etc. I decided to design a short tutorial <b>Along</b> with designing the tool for I knew what knowledge gap is there from the first-hand experiences of testing with users. </p> <a name="c_5"></a>
            <p>
                Designing the tutorial while designing the interface obviously made a lot of sense, while that was not how it worked for our main platform. For the main platform, when the UX team delivered the main concept, the management team created a separate manual explaining what each term means and when certain option should be used. While those manuals were nice to have, I always felt that they could be better. Since the management team created those manuals before they themselves spend enough time with those interfaces, the manuals missed some key tips that I included in the interface while designing those. The details of the tutorial design are included in the <a href = "http://soyeon.de/tutorial"><b>journal.</b></a></p>

            <span id = "impcontents">Goal: Lead a participatory design</span>
          
            <p>
           When joining this project, I paid a particular attention to make sure that the banner team fully becomes part of the conversation. Since the initial project owner was the banner team, I didn't want them to feel like the other team is taking over their work and ignoring what has been already done. Instead of setting up regular meetings, I initiated ad-hoc meetings with the banner team so that whenever there is an agenda to discuss, we could talk openly. The ad-hoc meeting usually lasted less than an hour and happened 3 or 4 times a week. 

            </p>
           
            
            <p>When I make a mock-up for the new Cuttlefish, I first shared it with the banner team. Since they have ample experiences designing the retargeting ads, they knew what controls are frequently used and what not. With this knowledge, I could balance creating an efficient tool that contains only the most-needed configuration. Then I talked to the developers to get the confirmation and align ideas. And then I tested with non-expert users. By repeating those processes, I created a participatory design loop. </p>
          
            <p>While focusing on gathering inputs from every party, I also made sure to be the new product owner; to be fully responsible for the design decisions, organize meetings and align designers and developers. One take-away from the previous cross-team collaboration project was that the great discussion leads to nothing without a clear ownership. Someone has to reflect the discussion into the actual product and make sure that everyone is heading towards the same direction. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the banner team, users and developers, discussions were always productive and encouraging. Instead of defending different perspectives, we all contributed and appreciated the input from the others.</p>
