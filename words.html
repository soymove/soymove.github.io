            <span id = summarytext>When we conduct a user research, one of the questions we ask is<br>
"If you can hire someone dedicated for you and you can give whatever task to this person, what do you want this person to do?"
<br>
If I can answer that question for myself, it will be "I want to hire someone who is superb at finding the right words."
</span>

<br><br>
            
            
            <p>There are various reasons why choosing the words is difficult and annoying. I think the most fundamental reason is that the words Do matter and influence the usability a lot. Yet, there are some other frequent reasons that make picking the right word difficult. </p>
            <p>
                <span id = impcontents>There is no space </span>
                <br>Often times, there is a limited space for the title or the label or the text inside a container such as a button. If label gets longer, that means the layout will break. A long title or label is generally not helpful in getting the ideas as well. </p>
              <p>
                <span id = impcontents>The word is taken </span>
                <br>Unfortunately, the word that can best describe the interaction is sometimes used in the other parts of the interface under different contexts. Or it is also possible that the words are being used in the industry with a different connotation. </p>
             <p>
                <span id = impcontents>The business has a second opinion </span>
                <br>Transparency is great but there are many ways to be transparent. The business team or the marketing team wants to highlight certain parts while putting less focus on the other parts. Sometimes, the word that fits the best in the context may have influence in the other upcoming features. </p>
            <p>
                After going through constant battles with the acronym and antonym dictionary, I came up with some little principles. One is to use icons. For example, when finding the word for the button that closes all the fields, one can use the icons that symbolize closing. Then the complementary word can be added such as "all" to highlight that all fields will be closed. When I need words for a more complex concept, I try to explain what this interaction does in a colloquial language to colleagues. During the conversation, I come up with some easy word that explains the purpose of the interaction or some useful analogy that helps picking the right word.
