            <span id = summarytext>When we conduct a user research, one of the questions we ask is<br>
"If you can hire someone dedicated for you and you can give whatever task to this person, what do you want this person to do?"
<br><br>
If I can answer that question for myself, it will be "I want to hire someone who is superb at finding the right words and make them take care o all the wordings."

            <p>1. Already taken

2. Too direct (business)
yes, hiding and avoiding certain words shall be fine. but wordings can adapt as well when the feature changes.
first goal is to make them understand 
 
 
 
3. Less space
- truncate, focus on the keywords. it actually help understanding.
ex) close all  tabs. Button hide all. ALL and the icon then what differentiates this action than the other actions.
