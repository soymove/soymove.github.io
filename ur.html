            <span id = summarytext>The start-up I work at is run by two founders who met in computer science phD programs. The production development is very code-oriented and there was no interaction designer but concept developer till my colleague and I joined. User research meant the summative user research, user testing basically.

            <p> To convince people that the formative user research is more than asking what people want and to start a proper user research practice, I needed a good planning. It fist started with identifying problems that our user research practice. So far, the user research was not formalized and occurred in the ad-hoc manner. Therefore, the documentation and sharing knowledge didn't happen and the target user was limited to few acquaintances. Also, the methodology was restricted to few and could not be tailored nor reviewed. In designing the user research plan, I therefore set the two goals : utilizing various and balanced methodologies that can serve the goal and covering diverse groups of users in global offices. Last but not least, I focused on systemizing the process so that the user research practice can be established.

            <div class = inimage id = "ur2">
            </div>
            
            <p>
When I proposed the user research plan, all the team members were willing to take parts. They saw the benefits; lots of learnings can happen in the process and the best way to get those is to be engaged in the entire process. While coordinating interviews with various platform users, my team and I designed the specific of the first phase of the user research, interviews and activities. We agreed on conducting three interviews/ activities.

            </p>
             <div class = inimage id = "ur3">
            </div>
            <p>
                <span id=impcontents>1. Three whys</span><br>
                Three whys start with asking the user "When you came to work today, did you have any goals to achieve in mind? What are the things you want to finish today?" As the user gives an answer, more whys follow. For example, if user answers
<br><br>
                A : My goal for today is to reply back to all the clients.<br>
Q : Why is it important to get back to them? What kinds of emails do clients send?<br>
A : They usually want to have more explanation on the performance.<br>
Q : Does that mean that the performance is not explained enough in the platform? Why would they ask those performance questions?<br>

               <br>
The goal of this interview/activity exercise is to get an idea of the user's main responsibility and understand the priorities of their daily work. The initial question is simple, but as the user continues giving more contexts and intension behind the activity, more questions follows. Instead of directly asking users what the most important task is in their daily tasks, this three why gets the answer in a step-by-step manner. It brings out the real story of the ordinary work-day, not the self-filtered answer of what one does or what one should do. 
            <br><br>
                <span id=impcontents>2. Ishikawa diagram</span><br>
                <div class = inimage id = "ur4">
            </div>
            <p>
                The original Ishikawa diagram that is invented and used for analyzing the causes of a specific event is adopted for the user research. In this exercise, user is  first asked to come up with one word (adverb/noun/etc.) that captures his/her idea of the current business platform. Then further questions follow asking them how various dimensions(interaction-wise, visual-wise, content-wise) influence the choice of words.
<br><br>
The aim of this exercise is to get a holistic impression that users have with the existing platform first and to find the supporting details. Usually when asked the opinions of the product, it ends up being the collection of the feature requests or pain points. Those are of course valuable and important; yet, it is sometimes easy to miss the big picture. For example, users may spend all time talking about "the missing explanation" and needs to add "various tooltips and more labels." After the interview, the researcher will get the idea to bring more of those explanation to the overall design. Yet, when asked the word that represents the general impression, the user may answer "simple and intuitive." If so, the researcher can see that while the user values the intuitive and simple interface, there are some sections that need some extra information. It is pivotal to get the big picture and Ishikawa diagram helps finding the accurate big picture. 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <span id=impcontents>3. Drawing</span><br>
            <p>
The drawing exercise asks user to express the "ideal" interface within 4 minutes by using the pen. The user is not allowed to refer to anything else but the memory. There are many researches arguing benefits of the drawing; it brings out the unconscious ideas and add new perspectives for it avoids using the verbal tool. When the user finishes the first drawing, the next drawing exercise follows which asks a very similar question with a slight twist: to express the "ideal" interface for the client (not for the internal users themselves).
             <br><br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur5">
            </div>
            After lots of coordination, we conducted the interview and activities with various users in person or via Skype. Each session was attended by two UX team members. While one member led the session, the other took notes and documented the findings. Then, right after the session we turned the notes into the initial summary.<br><br>

            <div class = inimage id = "ur6">
            </div>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur7">
            </div>
            
            <br><br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur8">
            </div>
            <p>
The notes grew day by day as we covered all the planned interviews in 8 weeks. It was time to close the interview/ activity phase and extract findings.
            </p>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur9">
            </div>
            <p>
The findings were first categorized and summarized by using the affinity grouping methods. Then, this finding was summarized into 3 main deliverables.
            </p>
            <br>
             <span id=impcontents>1. Persona</span><br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur12">
            </div>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur10">
            </div>
             <div class = inimage id = "ur11">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
Persona analysis was most needed since our platform has various group of users. Narrating all those voices with a single perspective didn't make sense. The persona includes responsibilities of this person, problems that this person often faces while using the platform, and the wants/ needs. An impressive quote during the interview was added.
            </p>
            <br>
            <span id=impcontents>2. Task flow</span><br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur13">
            </div>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur14">
            </div>
             <p>
The task analysis was drafted out while it needed to be complemented by the contextual inquiry and user observation. Through the interviews / activities, key tasks performed by using the platform were selected and how each persona is involved was discovered. Through the observation, the specifics of this task flow will be filled in.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
             <span id=impcontents>3. Wanted feature analysis </span><br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur15">
            </div>
            <p>
We collected all the wanted features and categorized those in groups : one that needs ideation, another in concepting, the other in blocked stage. Once the task flow analysis is completed, we can also match where these wanted features fit in and provide a more comprehensive concept.            </p>
