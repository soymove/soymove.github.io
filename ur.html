            The course started with an open discussion about Internet of Things(IoT) with Bruce Sterling, a science-fiction writer from cyber punk movement and a professor Massimo Banzi, a co-founder of Arduino. The brief was to design a household product that incorporates the idea of IoT. There were Many ideas at first, yet, the more I thought about each idea and talked about those with friends and classmates, the more I got doubtful. Do we need more products? Why does it feel wrong to make home smart and automated? Through repetitive discussions and iterations, the idea of Lpify came up. Somehow, music didn't feel like a luxury or a toy.

            <div class = "inimage" id = "lpify1">

            <p>
                While the initial idea was to copy the shape of traditional LP player, to give more of a furniture feeling and to make it easier to catch public's attention, we decided to put it on the wall. The choreography that we aimed was to have a closed circular rail so that vinyl can loop. Yet, rotating vinyl purely with gravity was harder than we though.
                So we decided to make two rails on each side. The vinyl stays in the que and gets played when it arrives on the center. Yet, the shape resembled a female's uterus.

            <div class = "inimage" id = "lpify2">

            <div class = "inimage" id = "lpify4">
            </div>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "lpify5">
            </div>
            <p>
                In the back side of the player, there was a webcam that takes pictures of the vinyl. Original picture → Rotate until the marker gets recognized → Desaturate → Adaptive Thresholding → OCR algorithms → Turn recognized texts it into a playlist → Music streaming API For there were many existing libraries, I could just combine those in need. While it took some iterations to find an optimized parameter for hand writing recognition, the final prototype could demonstrate how LPIFY works.
