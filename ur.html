<div class = inimage id = "ur1">              <a name="u_1"></a>

            </div><p>The start-up I work at is run by two founders with tech backgrounds. The product development is very technical-feature-oriented and user research meant the summative user research, user testing once in a while basically.
</p>
            
            
                        <span id = "impcontents">1.Planning & Involving team members</span>

            
            
            <p>To convince people that the formative user research is more than asking what people want and to establish a proper user research practice, I needed a good planning. It fist started with identifying problems with existing practices. So far, the user research was not formalized and occurred in the ad-hoc manner. Therefore, the documentation and sharing knowledge didn't happen and the target user was limited to few acquaintances. Also, the methodology was restricted to few and was not be tailored to the goals nor reviewed. In designing the user research , I therefore set the two goals : utilizing balanced methodology and covering diverse groups of users in global offices. Last but not least, I focused on systemizing the process so that the user research practice can be repeated regularly with ease.

            <div class = inimage id = "ur2">
            </div>
            <p>
When I proposed the user research plan, all the team members were willing to take parts. They saw the benefits; lots of knowledge would be generated in the research process and the best way to get those is to be engaged directly in the process. </p>
                        <div class = inimage id = "ur5">
            </div>
             <a name="u_2"></a>

            <p>After lots of coordination, we conducted the interview and activities with various users in person or via Skype. Each session was attended by two UX team members. While one member led the session, the other took notes and documented the findings. Then, right after the interviews and activities session, we summarized the learning through affinity diagrams. Before discussing the findings, let's discuss interviews and activities that we conducted. 

            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <p>
                <span id=impcontents>2. Interviews & Activities_ Three whys</span><br>
                 <div class = inimage id = "ur3">
            </div>
            <p>
                Three whys start with asking the user "When you came to work today, did you have any goals to achieve in mind? What are the things you want to finish today?" As user gives an answer, more whys follow. For example, if user answers</p>
<br>
                A : My goal for today is to reply back to all the clients.<br>
Q : Why is it important to get back to them? What kinds of emails do clients send?<br>
A : They usually want to have more explanation on the performance.<br>
Q : Does that mean that the performance is not explained enough in the platform? Why would they ask those performance questions?<br>
 <a name="u_3"></a>
               <br>
The goal of this exercise is to understand user's main responsibility and priorities of their daily work. The initial question is simple, but as the user continues, s/he gives more contexts and intension behind. Instead of directly asking users what the most important task is in their daily tasks, this Three why brings out the real story of the ordinary work-day, not the self-filtered answer of what one does or what one should do. 
            <br><br>
                <span id=impcontents>3. Interviews & Activities_ Ishikawa diagram</span><br>
                <div class = inimage id = "ur4">
            </div>
            <p>
                The Ishikawa diagram originally invented and used for analyzing the causes of a specific event is adopted for the user research. In this exercise, user is  first asked to come up with one word (adverb/noun/etc.) that captures his/her idea of the current business platform. Then further questions follow asking how various dimensions(interaction-wise, visual-wise, content-wise) influence the choice of words.
<br><br> <a name="u_4"></a>
The aim of this exercise is to get user's holistic impression on existing platform first and to find the supporting details. Usually when asked the opinions of the product, it ends up being the collection of the feature requests or pain points. It is sometimes easy to miss the big picture. For example, users may spend all time talking about "the lacking information" and needs to add "tooltips and more labels" when asked about the platform generally. Then, the researcher will get the idea to make overall design more detailed. Yet, if the researcher had asked the user to pick a word that represents the general impression, the user could have answered "simple." If so, the researcher would see the entire direction differently, knowing that users value the intuitive and simple interface. It is pivotal to get the big picture and Ishikawa diagram helps tuning the user's detailed feedback correct. 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <span id=impcontents>4. Interviews & Activities_ Drawing</span><br>
            <p><a name="u_5"></a>
The drawing exercise asks user to express the "ideal" interface within 4 minutes by using the pen. The user is not allowed to refer to anything else but the memory. There are many research supporting the benefits of the drawing; it brings out the unconscious ideas and add new perspectives that are filtered when using the verbal tool. When the user finishes the first drawing, the next drawing exercise follows which asks a very similar question with a little twist: to express the "ideal" interface for the client (not for the internal users themselves).

             <span id=impcontents>5. Consolidation_ Affinity diagram</span><br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur6">
            </div>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur9">
            </div>
                        <div class = inimage id = "ur8">
            </div>

                      <a name="u_6"></a>  
            <p>
While keeping the notes separately, the findings were  categorized and summarized by using the affinity grouping methods right after the session.

            <br>
             <span id=impcontents>6. Consolidation_ Persona</span><br>
            <p>
            After consolidating initial findings, we wondered what analysis can take these findings into the meaningful knowledge. Persona analysis was most needed since our platform has various group of users. Narrating all those voices with a single perspective didn't make sense. I initially created a persona per different platform usage types and went through the feedback process to make sure that the findings are well reflected.</p>

            <div class = inimage id = "ur12">
            </div>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur10">
            </div>
            <p>                      <a name="u_7"></a>  

             The persona includes responsibilities of this person, problems that this person often faces while using the platform, and the wants/ needs. An impressive quote during the interview was added.</p>
            <br>
           <br>
            <span id=impcontents>7. Consolidation_ Task flow</span><br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur13">
            </div>
            <p><a name="u_8"></a>  
            The next was the task analysis. Since many of the tasks that are handled in our business platform are collaborations, it was important to be able to track how a task is handled by various parties. When I attended a barcamp, there was a project manager who showed a cross-team task flow analysis by using rows so I used that approach in our task flow. Based on the interviews / activity, the key task was identified and task flow was drafted out. Yet, it needs to be complemented by the contextual inquiry and user observation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
             <span id=impcontents>8. Consolidation_  Wanted feature catalogue </span><br>
            <div class = inimage id = "ur15">
            </div>
            <p>
We collected all the wanted features and categorized those in groups : one that needs ideation, another in concepting, the other in blocked stage. This wanted feature catalogue will be constantly aligned and used as the consolidation goes on. For example, the wanted feature was already included in the persona analysis and can also be matched with the task flow.  </p>
            <br>
            <br><a name="u_9"></a> 
                        <span id=impcontents>9. Ongoing & future_ Contextual inquiry...</span><br>
<p>Currently we are working on conducting contextual inquiry and getting a close-up look of the user's platform usage. After this phase, we would be able to complete the initial consolidation of the user research findings and move on to the verification / validation stage by using more quantititaive user research methods such as surveys or interface tracking.</p>
