                I sometimes wonder if I know my team lead from Pittsburgh. While he is originally from Finland, he is a big fan of the Penguins. He follows the Steeler's games. In terms of design, he is a big fan of Brad Frost, a designer based in Pittsburgh who is known for the Atomic design.

<br><br>
            
            
            <p> Brad Frost is not the only one who emphasized the design pattern / design system. There are various design pattern related articles and guides. Yet, while the benefit is obvious, there are difficulties in transforming the entire platform into the one that follows a uniform pattern. In our cases, this transformation involved not just our team but also the graphic designers and developers that things got confusing from time to time. In retrospect, there are three categories of actions that we did during the transformation.
            </p>
            
               <p><span id= impcontents>
                   What we did and liked</span><br>
- State the goals and share : there are many levels of design patterns. Visual-only design pattern, Visual and behavior design pattern, Visual, behavior and logic included design pattern. We had a clear shared goal of what kinds/levels of design pattern we wanted to create and apply.<br>
- Benchmark : since the goal was clear and mutual, we shared the examples of the established design patterns and copied some categorization technique from those.<br>
- Finding the right unit size/ category : based on the benchmark, we knew which granularity of design pattern we would like to create. The grouping of components or categories was relatively easy.      
            </p>

             <p><span id= impcontents>
                  What we did at the end and relieved</span><br>
- Have a separate test page : in the middle of the transformation process, we developed a test page which applies the new design pattern in the existing platform. Albeit a bit late, this greatly helped figuring out the harmony and balance.<br>
- Documentation : along with the test page, we also created a documentation page for the agreed design pattern.<br>
- Focusing on cross-team communication : agreeing on the pattern and deciding what rules to apply for each pattern needed lots of collaboration. In the end, we set up a daily stand-up and mandated 1-1 communication everyday. 
            </p>
            <p><span id= impcontents>
                  What we lacked till the end</span><br>
- A wrong sense of ownership : in proceeding this transformation process, all the people involved held a shared ownership. The entire graphic design team focused on the visual aspect of the design pattern, the UX team focused on the behavior and logic aspect of the pattern and so on, the developer focused on implementation and so on. Yet, this global ownership was not very efficient since there were lots of small decisions to be made and due to the global ownership, it wasn't clear exactly whom in the other team should be invited to the discussion that each team ended up making the decision within the team. If we made a small group of teams made of the combination of graphic, ux, and developer, the overall communication could be faciliated and the design iterations could happen more smoothly. <br>
- User validation : in establishing the design pattern, we have not included the end-user's opinion. We were already overloaded to synchronize the various teams that we ended up missing the feedback from the actual user. This created a bit of a backfire in that we had to redefine certain parts of the design pattern from the scratch. <br><br><br>
