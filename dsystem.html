                My boss can be one good fan-boy. While he has Nothing to do with Pittsburgh, he is a big fan of the Penguins. The story of 10-y.o him sending a postcard to the Penguins and receiving tons of stickers and posters makes me smile all the time. Anyway, in terms of design, he is a fan of Brad Frost (who is coincidentally from Pittsburgh as well!), the one who is known for Atomic design. No wonder that we revamped the entire platform by applying the atomic design. The start was fun for we didn't know what a bumpy road is waiting ahead of us...

                What we did and liked :
- state the goals
- benchmark
- finding the chunk, focus on visual - behavior - separating logic - taking care of dependency

What we did at the end and relieved
- have a separate test page
- documenting
comonent documentation page hwere variaionts and test out
github, communication was documented
- communicate
a daily stand-up, multiple channels, direct communication over skype
but could be more focused on processes. and iterations

What was missing and lacking till the end
- don't create new elements on the go. abstract 
do not defend
- a wrong sense of ownership
cross-team ownership was needed
versioning to share the findings, show the process and other iterations
- user validation
