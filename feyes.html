            <span id = summarytext>People learn. When people are in the user-side, this is great but for me as a designer, it sometimes bothers. Since I get numb to the existing design, it gets hard to imagine what the app looks like in the objective manner, cannot imagine the new user's experience nor predict how new features can blend in. The old eyes are bothersome and my team found some activities that helped us getting back the fresh eyes.

            While keeping all the design, we swapped the contents of our main platform into those of the banking setting which has a similar user base. Surprisingly, just by changing some words and removing the logs, things all seemed to look different!</p>
      
             
        <p>
            Before even my brain notices, my eyes started to compare our platform to the banking platforms that I have used.<br>
            "Hmm. Something is off. It doesn't feel like the banking platform."<br> was the initial reaction and then I could describe the feeling in more details such as lack of the edgy/ business sharpness and lack of depth. Then even more details followed such as a need to make use of accent colors, stronger color, adding a bit of shadows or gradiation on the buttons or so and etc.

            <div class = "inimage" id = "feyes2">
            </div> 
            <p>
            It is important to find a comparable target to swap the contents with. In many cases it may not be easy to find a good target but still, just by getting rid of the accustomed logo, one may find an excuse to refresh eyes.

            The second bar camp was a "HuMitec barcamp" whose main topic was human factor. The size of the barcamp was definitely smaller and many talks were in german. I had a low expectation but in my first talk, I found myself repeaing "Everyone has something to teach." The speaker was a young student who is doing an internship in the local start-up hub. As a PM, he was explaining the flow chart that they are using to coordinate the client's onboarding experience. Each row represented a different team the task was represented as a node. Then at the top row, there was the client, and every touchpoint and experience of the client was specified there. The nodes of every team were connected to each other and also with the client experience. At the instant moment of looking at the image, I thought that is exactly what we should do on top of our existing user research - task flow analysis. Having various user groups who have different permission levels while collaborating with each other, that kind of overview will definitely clear out all the unnecessary steps or missing steps. It would be much easier to identify the breakpoints in the flow, to facilitate inter-department communication, to be aligned and to summarize the user experience in every level! The speaker continued on how they started designing the task flow in this manner, why they abandoned the top-down approach task analysis but rather focused on what individuals do. It was a small moment of enlightenment. It also made me realize that since this entire field is keep growing, to truly keep up-to-date, it is pivotal to be aware of what other people in the field are doing. While I did study Human Computer Interaction in the classroom under certain curriculum, this field is keep on growing, keep being dynamic. The knowledge is being generated in various small corners of the practitioners and everyone is willing to teach and share.

            It also reminded me of the characteristic of learning "soft" disciplines.  When I was surfing courses across varied schools back in the college, I used to swing between the "hard" and "soft" disciplines. Hard disciplines such as math, biology, computer science and physics were generally more demanding but they were also straight forward. I had to understand and familiarize with certain concepts and once the exam is over, I knew what I would get. On the other hand, soft ones such as design, art, psychology and history were almost always discussion based and learning could feel a bit blurry. The key take-away was in one crucial detail, or in context, or in some flickering smartness of one peer. The best way to guarantee a good grade in soft courses was being the diligent one; attending all courses to get the nuance of the subject, participating in discussions, showing professors that I do care and etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            Looking back, I think the design practice is quite the same. Being the diligent one, do the work, iterate, reflect and share. and learn, from everyone.
