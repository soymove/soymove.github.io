            <span id = summarytext>People learn. When people are in the user-side, this is great but for me as a designer, it sometimes bothers. Since I get numb to the existing design, it gets hard to imagine what the app looks like in the objective manner, cannot imagine the new user's experience nor predict how new features can blend in. The old eyes are bothersome and my team found some activities that helped us getting back the fresh eyes.

            <p><span id = impcontents>Swap : Keep everything but change the context</span><br>

            <div class = "inimage" id = "feyes">
            </div> <br><p>
            While keeping all the design, we swapped the contents of our main platform into those of the banking setting which has a similar user base. Surprisingly, just by changing some words and removing the logs, things all seemed to look different!</p>
      
             
        <p>
            Before even my brain notices, my eyes started to compare our platform to the banking platforms that I have used.<br>
            "Hmm. Something is off. It doesn't feel like the banking platform."<br> was the initial reaction and then I could describe the feeling in more details such as lack of the edgy/ business sharpness and lack of depth. Then even more details followed such as a need to make use of accent colors, stronger color, adding a bit of shadow or gradiation effect on the buttons or so and etc.     
    </p>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "feyes2">
            </div> 
            <p>
            It is important to find a comparable target to swap the contents with. In many cases, it may not be easy to find a good target but still, just by getting rid of the accustomed logo, one may find an excuse to refresh eyes.

                 <p><span id = impcontents>Contextual Inquiry</span><br>
            Looking at other people wearing my clothes is always weird. It helps looking at the clothes with the fresh eyes even though the design itself is identical. The same mechanism works here: when I conduct a contextual inquiry and observe the users actually interacting with the interface, I gain lots of new perspectives. I see the interface from their mouse cursor's viewpoint, with their devices, in their speeds. Even though the interface is identical, I end up noticing the details that I have been oblivious to.
