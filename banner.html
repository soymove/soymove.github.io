                Complaints about intrusive banner ads are everywhere, the habitual neglect on the banner termed as banner blindness has been identified, the average CTR is 0.1% and adblockers are becoming more widespread. How can we solve these issues? What kinds of positive experiences can banner ads bring to the user? How can banner experience be better? </span>

            One perk of working@Sociomantic is that I can spend one day at my work on the individual research. The research has to be relevant to the work, but not necessarily has to be the work. From January to May, I worked on designing alternative interaction models and completed the initial phase of the research project. The final deliverables were presented to the review boards, banner designers, sales /marketing teams in the global offices. </p>
            
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb2">
            </div> 
            <p>
            To talk about some good old days, a series of first banner ads appeared on the HotWired website in 1994. The AT&T’s You-Will banner was the most popular one, scoring 44% of CTR. The AT&T team said that they wanted to make ads feel like ”a sponsored pleasurable experience, not something people would run away from.” 20 years have passed since then. Unfortunately, the banner ads turned into just exactly the thing that people would run away from. The vast majority of banners, without questioning, copy the styles, the goals, and the interaction of the print media. The usage of user data in the banner creatives is far from being suave that instead of being perceived as ‘smart’, it raises the privacy concern to the users. Complaints about intrusive banner ads are everywhere, the habitual neglect on the banner termed as banner blindness has been identified, the average CTR is 0.1% and adblockers are becoming more widespread.

            </p>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb3">
            </div>
            <p>
               The resesarch was consisted of three parts: the analysis of the current sociomantic banner; the banner from the design agency; the banner from other ad-tech. Along with the research, alternative interactions models were ideated.
            </p>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb4">
            </div>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb5">
            </div>
            <p>
            After analysing the current banner @ sociomantic, several problems were identified.<br><br>
                
<span id = "impcontents">Information Overload</span>
There are too much information being presented in a limited space. Information is all visible in one screen, like the display interaction of the traditional banners in the print-media. Overloaded information cannot be processed by brain easily and also, since information is not divided into a chunk, it is hard to distinguish the information hierarchy.


                <br><br> <span id = "impcontents">Disconnected Information</span>
All elements in the banners are serving their roles independently without making connected stories with other elements or considering the flow of information within the banner. The elements are not interacting with one another and just serving its own role. 


              <br><br>  <span id = "impcontents">No Specialization</span>
All elements such as product information, brand information, Promotion information and hook are mandatory and there is no banner that focuses on one of those. Every banner is an all-round player; there is no banner that is dedicated to, say, the upper funnel marketing and focusing on delivering brand information. An account manager in Amsterdam office said clients want to have banners that tell something about the offering (awareness) instead of showing a product template. (sales driven)


              <br><br>  <span id = "impcontents">Too Technical</span>
While the technology is dominating every aspect of the life, it has not brought down the strong influence that emotional and social components have on human communication. Human communication is still very humane; nice images can overpower the facts, tones and attitudes can overwhelm the actual contents of the communication, and the touch of humor can create an emotional connection with the user. Yet, current Sociomantic’s banners are not making use those emotive aspects of human communication. Banners need to equip the friendly humanly face to start talking to the users.


               <br><br> <span id = "impcontents">Lagged Update</span>
Clients want to try variations of banners to see how they (may) influence the performance. For they have limited controls in the programmatic display, they are keen on experimenting with creatives. However, Sociomantic currently allows revamping the banner only once per 6 months. The rationale behind is that it takes about 2 weeks to make a set of banners and the influences those changes make on performance are barely noticeable. However, giving more control to the client itself is valuable and also from the user’s perspectives, it is not fun at all to see the same banner (same copy, color, buttons, images) for 6 months.

            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb6">
            </div>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb6-2">
            </div>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb7">
            </div>

            <p>
               There were key learnings from the analysis of Creative agency’s banner.
                
               <br><br> <span id = "impcontents">Personal and Emotive</span>
To repeat the quotes from the Google’s founder or Saatchi’s chairman, advertisement is a very humane communication where emotion plays a key role. By examining the sample banners, several methods of eliciting more emotional responces have been identified such as using an ad copy and adding a relevant information that can be positively associated with the advertised product.  

                <br><br><span id = "impcontents">Data into Banner Interaction </span>
Banners can interact with the users in the most data-rich manner. There are a cookie data that includes user’s previous activities on the advertiser’s site, contextual information of the user and publisher’s content data. This data can be used to target the “right user” and find the “right product” but also to “communicate nicely.” Banner can dynamically and implicitly change its way of communication. There are many sample banners have adapted the image and ad copy based on the users while presenting the exact same product.

               <br><br> <span id = "impcontents">Customized and Specialized</span>
The most easily noticeable character of the collectd sample banners are that they are all different. Based on the industry, advertised product and the goal of the campaign, the banner should behave and be approached differently. 
                
            </p>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb8">
            </div>  
            <p>
What was interesting was how ad-tech and other competitors are challenging the traditional templatized banner. Albeit it is not as customized and tailored as the agency's banner, there were some conspicuous trends.
                
              <br><br>  <span id = "impcontents"> Real Time Feedback on Banner Performance </span>
The banners from the competitors are closely tied to the analytics and performance data. Based on how the banner is performing real-time, the creatives react to it and explore alternative modes of communication. This data is also open to the clients (in Google’s case) so that clients can have another dimension of insights.

               <br><br> <span id = "impcontents"> Extensive Tool Kits</span>
While the tech-oriented banners from the competitors do not come up with the most tailored and personalized banners (compared to the agency’s banner), they provide the extensive templates and the tool kits that the advertiser can explore and experiment. 

               <br><br> <span id = "impcontents">Full Tech Investment to Design Banner </span>
Another characteristic of the competitor’s banners is that they are aware of many things and react to those. Not only the device information but aslo the size, type of the inventory and  the styles of the publisher’s content influence the banner. 
            </p>
<center>-------------------</center>         <br>
<p>To move on to the design part, there were various interaction models that were suggested but the most focused aspect on those new interaction models were the "Social banner" type.</p><br>
            
            <span id = "impcontents">Social Banner Model </span><br>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb11">
            </div>
            <p>The key idea in the social banner concept is that the contents are all user generated and the curating and filtering happens automatically so that the real-time information can be delivered without a delay. In otherwords, in the world of "social banner", everyone is advertising everything. For example, if the coffee shop X opts in for the social banner service and target everyone in the neighborhood, any picture taken at the cafe will be in a real-time manner delivered to the neighbors. The coffee shop X can do more curation such as using only the contents from the specific range of age groups.</p>
            
            <span id = "impcontents">Social Banner Example </span><br>
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb9">
            </div>  
            <div class = "inimage" id = "sb10">
            </div>
            <p>
              <span id = "impcontents">Strengths of the Social banner</span><br>
                  Main benefit of the social banner is that the advertiser can releash the full potential of the user-generated contents out there. With the sophisticated filtering and targeting technology, the real stories and real contents that are created by other actual users can be used for the promotion. Compared to the traditional advertising, the usage of user-generated contents directly has more authenticity and less hassles. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Non-typical Look-and-feel and the real time update speed of the user generated contents can also bring the dynamic energy into the display advertising market which has been criticized for its outdatedness. </p>
            <p>
                          <span id = "impcontents">Weakness of the Social banner</span><br>

           Of course, there is a limit in the applicable business model since user generated contents are not for every business. The advanced curating and targeting technology should also be applied properly to maximize the power of the contents.</p>
