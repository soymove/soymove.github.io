                Is The Tutorial A Proof of An Unintuitive Design?

                            I sometimes wonder if my boss, originally from Finland, actually is someone I have known from Pittsburgh. He is a big fan of the Penguins. He follows Steeler's games. In terms of design, he is a fan of Brad Frost, a designer from Pittsburgh who is known for his atomic design. No wonder that we revamped the entire platform by applying the atomic design.</div>

                When Fresh Eyes Are Gone
                </div>People learn. When people are in the user-side, this is great but for me as a designer, it sometimes bothers. Since I get numb to the existing design, it gets hard to imagine what the app looks like in the objective manner, cannot imagine the new user's experience nor predict how new features can blend in. The old eyes are bothersome and my team found some activities that helped us getting back the fresh eyes.</div>

                A Hidden Task of the UX Designer
                </div> Couple months ago, there was a cross-team workshop. I was teamed with two analysts with sales and business backgrounds and one visual designer. The challenge was to make a campaign for a household retailer so we started looking at the retailer’s website and understand the market, strength, unique selling point and so on. After the initial analysis, the next thing to do was to ideate : What kinds of experience should the campaign create?
