                The earlier you fail, the better. That is indeed the charm of the low-fi testing. Even before adding the colors or finding the right look-and-feel, user can validate the ideas. Yet, there are things to consider when conducting low-fi testing, especially when the subject matter is complex. 
            </span>

<br>
        <p>Here is a short conversation that happend during one of the low-fi testings. The user had to complete a rather complex task by making use of various components. With the low-fi prototype, user failed to finish the task that I reviewed the process with the user again. <br><br>
Me : Did you notice that button?<br>
User : Oh  right! I didn't notice that button. The button should be highlighted, like in a different color.<br>
            Me : I see. What about that text? Did you understand what it says? <br>
            User : Well, now that I read it, this is also very important. Can it be bigger? <br>
            Me : Sure. Have you checked the disclaimer in the bottom though?<br>
            User : Hmm this disclaimer is very important. What about you put it here? Or maybe there instead to make it stand out?<br>
            Me : We can try. How would you rank the priorities of those three elements?<br>
            User : All top priorities I think. they are all very important. <br>
            <br>
            </p>

            <p>The problem in the situation above is that I could not get any answers to my question. I knew that all those three are important; what mattered was how. The main reason why I didn't get the "how" answer is in the complex interaction, lots of cues such as color and font are needed to catch the user's attention in various and subtle ways. In the low-fi prototype, those details do not exist. However, it is true the low-fi prototype definitely can generate more proactive feedback in that user feel free to give suggestion. (as shown above)
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep the benefit while still being able to get the answer that I need, I conducted lowfi-testing in the A/B testing format. In each version of the lowfi prototype, the highlighted element was different. When following thies A/B testing format, user has to give a preference and this could naturally give an ansewr to which element is more crucial for certain tasks. (even though they are all crucial)
