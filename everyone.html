            <span id = summarytext>While I have been to handful of conferences, seminars and meet-ups, it was very recent that I attended a 'barcamp.' In the barcamp, there is no set speaker; audience literally leads the entire conference.</span>

            The first bar camp that I have been to is "UXcamp 2017." It was a Europe-based barcamp that focuses on the UX related topics and there were surprisingly many non-germans. On day one, listening to people giving a pitch, I could see one clear advantage of the bar camp; compared to traditional conferences where there is one or few tracks, there were 6 tracks of talk going on in the bar camp. The ratio of talk to participants were really high that I could enjoy the entire experiences in the most customized way. Yes, the quality of the talk could be hit or miss for many reasons. Since the pitch is short, it is not enough to measure the relevancy of the talk to my interest. The level of the discussion depends a lot on the audience of the talk which is hard to predict in advance. Yet, I had the freedom to move away from one talk to the other which at the end made me engaged in most of the talks.

            My favorite part of the barcamp was not just the diversity of the talk, but the "empathetic ambiance." The speaker wasn't the design head of some global IT companies who is talking about some big agenda. The speaker was someone who just finished a project that is similar to mine, who has been through similar struggles. By no means I am saying that one is better than the other, but I realized what a good system a barcamp is to share the rather minuscule but important knowhows and details in the daily practice. The communal supportive feeling continues in the discussion after the talk as well. For example, I joined one talk on design pattern where the speaker focused on how to treat design system as an independent product so that it can be taken care of after the initiation. After the talk, one developer asked what would be a good approach to spread this thought to designers who are reluctant to follow the design pattern system and at the same time one designer asked the opposite. It was obvious that both designers and developers see the value of the design system but the focus is different. It was a matter of balancing the overgrowing or withering of the design system not about on the usefulness of the design system at all. The conversation was reminiscent of various talks that I had internally when we were revamping our own platform. It made me to re focus on the maintenance of the design patterns but in an emotional level, it was indeed soothing to know that it is not just a struggle that happens within my organization but something that can happen everywhere.

            The second bar camp was a "HuMitec barcamp" whose main topic was human factor. The size of the barcamp was definitely smaller and many talks were in german. I had a low expectation but in my first talk, I found myself repeaing "Everyone has something to teach." The speaker was a young student who is doing an internship in the local start-up hub. As a PM, he was explaining the flow chart that they are using to coordinate the client's onboarding experience. Each row represented a different team the task was represented as a node. Then at the top row, there was the client, and every touchpoint and experience of the client was specified there. The nodes of every team were connected to each other and also with the client experience. At the instant moment of looking at the image, I thought that is exactly what we should do on top of our existing user research - task flow analysis. Having various user groups who have different permission levels while collaborating with each other, that kind of overview will definitely clear out all the unnecessary steps or missing steps. It would be much easier to identify the breakpoints in the flow, to facilitate inter-department communication, to be aligned and to summarize the user experience in every level! The speaker continued on how they started designing the task flow in this manner, why they abandoned the top-down approach task analysis but rather focused on what individuals do. It was a small moment of enlightenment. It also made me realize that since this entire field is keep growing, to truly keep up-to-date, it is pivotal to be aware of what other people in the field are doing. While I did study Human Computer Interaction in the classroom under certain curriculum, this field is keep on growing, keep being dynamic. The knowledge is being generated in various small corners of the practitioners and everyone is willing to teach and share.

            It also reminded me of the characteristic of learning "soft" disciplines.  When I was surfing courses across varied schools back in the college, I used to swing between the "hard" and "soft" disciplines. Hard disciplines such as math, biology, computer science and physics were generally more demanding but they were also straight forward. I had to understand and familiarize with certain concepts and once the exam is over, I knew what I would get. On the other hand, soft ones such as design, art, psychology and history were almost always discussion based and learning could feel a bit blurry. The key take-away was in one crucial detail, or in context, or in some flickering smartness of one peer. The best way to guarantee a good grade in soft courses was being the diligent one; attending all courses to get the nuance of the subject, participating in discussions, showing professors that I do care and etc.

            Looking back, I think the design practice is quite the same. Being the diligent one, do the work, iterate, reflect and share. and learn, from everyone.
