                I sometimes wonder if I know my current boss from Pittsburgh. While he is originally from Finland, he is a big fan of the Penguins. He follows the Steeler's games. In terms of design, he is a big fan of Brad Frost, a designer based in Pittsburgh who is known for the Atomic design.

            <p>
                What we did and liked :
- state the goals
- benchmark
- finding the chunk, focus on visual - behavior - separating logic - taking care of dependency

What we did at the end and relieved
- have a separate test page
- documenting
comonent documentation page hwere variaionts and test out
github, communication was documented
- communicate
a daily stand-up, multiple channels, direct communication over skype
but could be more focused on processes. and iterations

What was missing and lacking till the end
- don't create new elements on the go. abstract 
do not defend
- a wrong sense of ownership
cross-team ownership was needed
versioning to share the findings, show the process and other iterations
- user validation
