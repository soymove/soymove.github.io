              One of the most frequently used advice in UX design is to follow the 'Less is more' principle. They say that UX is like a joke; if you have to explain, it is not good. Yet, there is always an exception: if one tutorial/explanation can save loads of confusion or misunderstanding, I'd say it is better to explain a bit.

            <p>
I am not saying that tutorials are good for every user experience. For a static website that does not involve complex interactions, I think it is best to make use of the learned behaviors of hte users. There are still some cases that can benefit from the tutorials. </p><br>
            
<span id="impcontents">1. Is there any prerequisite knowledge that users should know?<br></span>
            <p>
No matter how good the interface is designed, some interfaces will inevitably contain some jargons. The problem is these jargons will be like the air for most users but not for all. What is the best way to cover this key knowledge? Of course, you can let the beginner users to search for the information by themselves. Yet, if one or two simple paragraphs in the beginning of the user experience can explain the missing knowledge, I would prefer providing those through the tutorial.</p>

2. Is there a crucial tip in using the interface?<br></span>
            <p>
When I first learned baking, my roommate gave some good tips that I still make use of. The tips are broad and can be applied to various contexts. (for example, use a little bit of salt almost all the time to bring out flavors.) As a designer, there are some core ideas that led to the final design as well and those ideas may not seem apparent to the users at first. For example, things like recommended user flow can be shared to the user so that the first-time users can orient themselves faster and with less hassles.            </p>
<p>          The next challenge is to design the usable and delightful tutorials. I have seen some websites who provided long tutorials trying to cover every detail including a rather obvious element. For this, it is time to bring back the old saying, "Less is more."</p>
