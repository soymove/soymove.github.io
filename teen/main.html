        <h2><b>
        Banks today are afraid that today's teenagers will not use their services in the future. Develop a service that is relevant to a teen's needs today, maintains a connection to banking, and has the potential to spread virally.</b>
        </h2>
            
        <p>
        My initial question was simple:<br>
        "Did I use bank 10 years ago?"<br>
        "Not much."<br>
        "Do I use bank now then?"<br>
        "Yes"<br>
        "Why?"<br>
        "To get paid at the company and use the credit card. I hate carrying cash."<br>
        And I soon realized that I myself am not making full use of the bank service. Those basic withdrawing service can be easily replaced; for example, if the cryptocurrency becomes more widespread. The blockchain-based transaction  is much faster and more efficient can replace the existing bank transaction.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>
        I decided to start on the initial research on what other services banks offer.</h2>

        <h2>
        <ul class = "contents_ul">
        <li>The most frequent word that can be found in the bank website is <b>Investment</b> and <b>Asset management.</b></li>
        <li>There is rarely a service for teens. There are customer-oriented services such as retirement planning or college planning for kids, but <b>no service that teens can directly participate in.</b></li>
        <li>Existing Applications on teen's finance focus on keeping track of the spending.</li>
            <li>Experts emphasize that it is critical to <b>learn healthy financial habits</b> in the early age.</li>
            </ul>
            </h2>
        <p>
            What I found interesting was <b>while banks highlight the asset investment or long-term assemt management, it is hard to find a service that helps teens see the money in long-term.</b>It is understandable for teens usually do not have a huge sum of income nor a regular one. However, isn't the long-term asset managment a core learning that teens should have? Can we teach them how to plan a month-ahead or even a year-ahead with their money?</p>

  <h1>Ideation/ Research : </h1>
        <h2>
        <li>What about supporting teens in their <b>Gap year</b> planning?</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
        The first thing that came to my mind when thinking of long-term planning for teen was the Gap Year. After highschool, lots of teens use / take a break to explore the world outside of classrom. <b>Traveling</b> is definitely one of the most popular ones, but in general, this break / gap year time provides teens with time to explore the world and learn about <b>who you are(the ultimate quest of the teenager years)</b> while <b>having fun(the highest priority of the teenager years)</b> and <b>doing cool stuff(the essence of the teenager years)."</b> </p>
        <p>I personally had a backpacking trip after highschool with friends and met lots of other groups of teenagers who were doing the exact same thing. We and they all planned ahead, took some part-time job, and saved some money for the trip. It would be great if there is a service that helps teens figure out what kinds of Gap year to plan and guide what to do to achieve that goal financially. </p>
        <p>
            Yet, while discussing this idea in-depth with a friend, one weakness of this service has been identifed: the Gap-year planner service is one-on-one based. Yes, individual teens will get the customized help and learn about the long-term financial planning but how can this service be spread out? In what ways this service can go <b>viral?</b>
            </p>
            <h2><li>Teens are eager tobreak their shells and discover themsleves but at the same time, they are very <b>keen on peer's action and opinions.</b></li></h2>
            <p>While peer pressure is often portrayed as a negative thing, fundamentally it is just the state of mind that is more sensitive to the others around. If those social characteristics of the teens can be used for a positive cause, that will be the strongest driver for learning, for exploring and for other goods. Many people that I met during the gap year travel were traveling in a group. Especially as they were younger or travelling in more adventurous areas, they tend to be more collective. I also realized that the collective actions made the planning part really fun. It does help you stay on focused, stay movitaved.</p>
            <p>As the discussion developes, it became apparent that a service that provides a long-term financial planning by using the social incentives can be applied to many other domains. A gap year planning is a good use case of this collective financial planning, however, there could be various scenarioes that teens could benefit from this peer pressrue / peer support. If so, what about designing a social finance planning platform?</p>

  <h1>Final Concept : </h1>
        <h2>
            <li>COMM'ON is the ONLY <b>PLATFORM where users can create, share, invite, join and browse long-term financial goals.</b> </li>
            <li>COMM'ON is the ONLY <b>TOOL where customized long-term financial goals are managed and tracked</b> through quick-and-easy interaction.</li>

                    <li>It <b>synchs with the bank account real-time</b> and fascilitates transferring money from checking account to the saving account.</li>
        <li>It divides the long term financial goal into a weekly goal and <b>helps users conquer their goals by little stpes.</b></li>
            <li>It helps users create the financial goals and invite / share with others. Likewise, users can also join / browse financial goals created by others.</li>
            <li>It <b>updates users about the progress of others</b> who have the same financial goal.</li>
            <li>It provides <b>a communication channel amongst users who share the same financial goals.</b>
            </li>
            <li>It keeps track of the invidiaul's pace in a <b>visual</b> way.</li></h2>
            <br>
            <h1>Strength :</h1>
        <h2><li><b>Peer-pressure to achieve a financial goal</b> </li></h2>
        <p>
            In COMM'ON, each financial goal is closely tied to the social group.<b>There are many researches in Psychology proving how "telling your goals to others" raises the chance of the goal being realized.</b> Even a simple telling of the goals to others can create a peer pressure, and individuals try harder to live up to it which results in more success than keeping the goal to oneself. In COMM'ON, users not only tell the goal but are grouped with people who agreed to accomplish the goal which fosters the peer-pressure. How other members in the group is "stacking" or saving up the money is communicated rel-time to the rest of the member strenghtening an implicit peer pressure. </p>
    
         <h2><li><b>Social interaction to keep on moving</b> 
             </li></h2>
        <p>Each financial goal has a dedicated communication space, which allows all the members to <b>freely discuss and share related topics.</b> Often times, the goals, especially long-term goals, are forgotten and neglected. This communication channels empowers all the members to <b>remind each other and trobule shoots a related-issue</b> to achieve the goal.

            <h1>Interaction Highlights:</h1><br>
              <div class ="img_mid" id = "f1">
            </div> 
            
                  <h2><b>Quick and efficient drag-and-drop landing page</b>
</h2>
            <p>The landing page of the app has a simple drag-and-drop interface. It does not require you to move to another tab or visit each goal to stack up the money; just by dragging the punch icon to the wanted goal, user can stack up the money. This is an interfce that I found very useful and convenient while doing a research on the relevant app. ("CoinKeeper")</p>
            <br><br>
            <div class ="img_mid" id = "f2">
            </div> 
            <h2><b>Focus on Bite-size goals</b></h2>
            <p>The huge sum of money is what users want to get <b>at the end</b> but it is not something that can be easily done. How to solve this problem? Only focus on the weekly goals in the interface so that users do not get overwhelemed. Especially for teens who may be accustomed to instant gratification, a small chunk of goal will be useful to stay on focused. Also, managing the money in a weekly basis helps users not get distracted and be more closely tied to the COMM'ON app.</p><br><br>
                  <div class ="img_mid" id = "f3">
            </div> 
            <h2><b>A touch of gaming</b></h2>
            <p>In the dedicated communication space for the financial goal, the name of users appear on the upper side along with the profile picture instead of a name. ˜The profiles are sorted by the amount of user's weekly stack and also, when the user acoomplishes the weekly goal, the user's profile picture is bordered. This intensifies the peer-pressure in a game-like way while not directly telling user that s/he is falling behind.</p>
            <p>Also, when user achieves the weekly goal, the automatic message <i>(User) just stacked (amount) and reached the weekly goal!</i> appears and is delivered to everyone in the chatroom. This message works as a reminder and also a communication started which brings user's attention to this financial goal.</p><br><br>
                  <div class ="img_mid" id = "f4">
            </div> 
            <h2><b>Full support for social interactions</b></h2>
            <p>It is not just the amount of money that is being displayed in each chatroom. It is a fully-supported chatroom with options to attach pictures or use emoticons. It is a communication system that can work as a support system among the users with the same financial goal, or it can be simply used for the socila purpose. The important thing is that social interactions are where people spend most of their time (especially in the mobile phone usage) and when used properly this can allow users to be more engaged with COMM'ON app and achieving their financial goals. </p><br><br>
                  <div class ="img_mid" id = "f5">
            </div> 
        <h2><b>Positivity</b></h2>
            <p>The tone of COMM'ON app is not <italic>punishing or checking</italic> users but on <italic>reinfocing</italic>users to the goals that they have set. It focuses on making the action and accomplishing concrete missions that they have set for themselves.</p>

        <li><b>Especially, involve Users!</b> The weak spot of this concept is that the actual target users, teens, have not been involved in the design process due to the time constraint of the design challenge.

            <li><b>Competitive Research</b>While a brief research on existing financial services and financial related application has been done, not the entire space has been covered.
