            <span id = summarytext>While sorting out the feedback one day, we found a positive but quite detrimental user story.<br>

"I was on a holiday in Italy and in the middle of sun-bathing, I realized that I forgot to schedule some adgroups. Luckily, I borrowed someone else's phone (my phone had no data), logged in to the platform, and changed everything in 5 minutes."

It is a supreme example showing
- the platform is responsive and works well with the phone.
- the platform functions well (the quality, loading speed and everything) that a simple task can be handled in 5 minutes.

YET, it was like a bomb for the app development for so far, the main use case that the app team relied upon was,
"a quick adjustment without going through the desktop." If the responsive platform can take over that main use case, what is the reason of existence for 5 great and passionate app developers (mobile + web) are for?

From UX team's perspective, we have been quite against on keep on developing the app which is basically the copy version of the mobile platform. We asked for a user research with potential clients to find the hidden niche for the app so that it doesn't just become one of those app you try and remove since it has no added values. Yet, the business team valued (and still does) the app for the sake of app. I do understand why they want to develop an app and gather the app-based loyal user. Instagram, Facebook messenger and all all want those daily app-users as well, right? Still, I do think that the current approach of developing the copy cat version of the app and hoping to figure out the problem next holds risks in many domains.
except for mobility or other sensors


1. While there are already numerous articles focusing on the difference of mobile vs desktop app, I will add my 5 cents as a ux designer and experiencer.
In my personal experience, app experience suits better for the "intimate" and "real-time" experience
in the bed (before sleeping checking the screen caressing some pets, no need to use mouse, just simple scrolling , swping and ocaasional clicking) vs on the desk (with other applications, calculators and so on, click and drag and hover and multitask and cop pating all the time)

2. Trigger-based?

my action (coin tracker, period tracker)

3. Fun?
