            <span id = summarytext>While sorting out the feedback one day, we found a positive but quite detrimental user story.<br>

"I was on a holiday in Italy and in the middle of sun-bathing, I realized that I forgot to schedule some adgroups. Luckily, I borrowed someone else's phone (my phone had no data), logged in to the platform, and changed everything in 5 minutes."
</span>
<br>
            
            
            <p>
To see the sunny side, the story is a supreme example showing<br>
- the platform is responsive and works well with the phone<br>
- the platform is designed well that a simple task can be handled in 5 minutes<br>
<br>
YET, it was like a bomb for the app development for the user story was the exact main use case that the app team has relied upon.If the responsive platform can take over that main use case of the app, what is the reason of existence for 5 great and passionate app developers (mobile + web)?</p>
            
            <p>
In fact, UX team has been quite against with developing the app in the current maner- which is basically creating a copy version of the web platform. We asked for an opportunity to conduct a user research with potential clients to find the hidden niche for the mobile platform. Otherwise, it will be one of those apps that one tries (or doesn't even try) and removes after a week since it has no added values.Yet, the business team has valuedthe app for the sake of having a mobile platform.</p>
            <p>
                This let me think about some of the key things that can make the mobile platfom shine. Instagram, Facebook messenger and all other messange apps gain stunning engament. When would the the mobile platform be needed? (ignoring the obvious cases that use the device-unique features such as camera or accelerator sensors.)</p>
<p>
    <span id= impcontents>Is the experience Intimate? </span>
    <br>Here, I would define the "intimate" experience as a kind of an experience that user may like to do before going to sleep. If the end-user experience fits in to the scenario of user about to fall asleep, in bed, caressing pets, and checking the phone, I think the app would make a good use of this intimate environment. It is different from the typical desktop use cases, where there is a mouse and where there are lots of other other applications running along with the prpoduct. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <span id = impcontents>Is the experience trigger-based?</span><br>
            The trigger can be many things. It can be the real-time updates from myself. A personal finance tracker or period tracker belongs to this category. More common examples make use of the external triggers such as the messengers which users other's messages as a trigger or the trading app that alars users with the real-time price change. When the experience is driven by those real-time triggers, the mobile platform will be perfect since not many people always carry arund their desktop and be notified on time.</p>
