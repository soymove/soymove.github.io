            <p>
            The brief of professor Bill Keays, who is also a Tech advisor at the Cirque du Soleil, was similar to a real brief of a client. They were designing a show with 'ice' theme and we, as a designer had to come up with new interactive experiences that fit into the theme. 
            There were couple other conditions as well : the show is based on the arena, and it is going to be a traveling show. While we know it was a practice, we were a little more excited than usual for it is Cirque du Soleil that is known for creating magical experiences!</p>
            <p>
                The first thing that came into my mind when I heard 'snow' was it's transient nature and how that can work as a metaphor of how humans connect. People, while the degree may vary, do not fully reveal themselves at first. It goes well with the image of the human kept inside the ice for you can see the person while not being able to touch the real matter. It takes a continuous investment of time and efforts to get comfortable with each other. Once the connection is established, people start expressing their true feelings and thoughts without hesitation. This gives rise to the faces that they themselves have not yet discovered and expose them to the new domain of life. The progress from frozen to thawed corresponds to evolution of human relationship : from silence to conversation, from static to dynamic, from cold to warm, from isolation to integration. This transition happens in a smooth, rather inconspicuous, manner, which resembles that of ice melting. My goal was to make an ice block that human can actually go inside.

            <p>
            I searched for materials : I baked different types of plexiglas to mimic ice's semi-transparency and to create little bubbles, however, it didn't work that well. Different types of plexiglas didn't get mixed well. </p>

            <p>
                I decided to just go with painting over the polycarbonate.

             <p>
                 After layers of painting and erasing it out, my block of polycarbonate was covered with ice looking white paint.

            <p>
                 I used a blue-filtered spotlight to add a cold atmosphere and to dramatize the look of an ice.
                 During the exhibition, people were dragged to this block of ice for its big scale.
                 They went into the block, took pictures, posted on facebook all the time. I could understand why some people are so enthusiastic about uploading or posting things because it feels nice when my work gets likes!

            <p>
            The pair of the interactive gloves was also a part of my interactive experience. This pair of glove shines when each glove gets touched to another. Therefore to glow this glove up, one has to hold hands with each other. The circuit was straightforward: make two open circuits and when gloves get touched they close the circuit and light up the LEDs.

<br><br><br><p>To end, here goes a poem:<br><br><br> <b>Fire and Ice by Robert Frost</b><br> <br>
            Some say the world will end in fire, <br>
Some say in ice. <br>
From what I’ve tasted of desire <br>
I hold with those who favor fire. <br>
But if it had to perish twice, <br>
I think I know enough of hate <br>
To say that for destruction ice <br>
Is also great <br>
And would suffice.<br>
